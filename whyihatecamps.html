<h1>So I am going to tell you, why I hate object camps.</h1>
<h1></h1>
1. stupid sign ups system
    there is a joke signups that should be declined but some (bbf) doesnt understand that
<h1></h1>2. contesting
    it is pure random, will you survive or not
<h1></h1>2.5. voting
    if the camp is not bot/pure random powered, people will choose on your (maybe even nonexistent) opinions
<h1></h1>3. speed camps
    "You have 4 hours to do this!" DO YOU FRICKING KNOW THAT THERE IS TIMEZONES AND SOMEONE WOULD BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE THEY'RE WAS SLEEPING?!
<h1></h1>3.5. extremely slow camps
    Some people are really impatient for challenge and elimination, but they have to wait for a looong time
<h1></h1>4. Voting system is unfair
    Once you get first on a challenge, people mostly try to vote you to get out and you probably get eliminated, but when you get last, you almost dont get votes, look people put effort in their challenges to get first
<h1></h1>4.5. VtS
     some people use "vote to save" system which is way worse
<h1></h1>5. "the best __ will get in"
    Some people hate ones that are bad at drawing or making assets, they literally want people who are good
<h1></h1>6. drawing skills
    so you need to relearn how to draw objects unless you're not getting in
<h1></h1>7. Bad camp lore
    Some camps have bad lore making the camp less interesting
<h1></h1>7.5 bad wikis
    If admin/host about to create a wiki, it can/would be with bad pictures, explanations. (and pictures can be sketches that are done in 5 minutes)
<h1></h1>8. non object camps
    Look, it was firstly originated as objects WHY ANYONE WOULD MAKE A NON OBJECT CAMP?!!
<h1></h1>9. "last one who did the __ dies" / did not participate
    the last person that made the solution/animation or whatever, is eliminated because HE IS LAST HAHA LOOK AT THIS BOZO (sarcasm)
<h1></h1>10. no quitting
    some camps have "no quitting" rule, but quitting is really important when you dont feel like competing anymore or have lots of stuff to do and etc. _or you will go thru malbolge and get 294857607100 warnings_
<h1></h1>11. forcing members to join/advertise
   hosts/admins literally forces you to join/advertise to others but I DONT WANT TO DO THIS! AND I WILL NOT ADVERTISE YOUR STUPIDY!
<h1></h1>11.5. spam advertising
    advertises 1-5 times per day in the same server. THATS ENOUGH BRO WE SEE IT
<h1></h1>12. experiments camp
    lol this is beginning of the virtual concentration camp, and i dont want to be an Petri dish for experiments, this is deprivation of one's dignity!
<h1></h1>13. host in another place (Whatsapp, Telegram, etc.)
    ok you advertised in discord but why hosting in another place? its unfair
<h1></h1>14. verification system
    lots of camps have the verification system. You have to wait for like 1 day (or it can take for âˆž days to verify you)
<h1></h1>15. profanity
    No, you are not in Russia to speak every word as swear! Do you have any etiquette feelings?
